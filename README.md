# Subscriber_Data_Analytics
This is a Telecom domain Analytics project where an association rule algorithm(Apriori Algorithm) is run which identifies the items purchased together by a subscriber. 
If the user is subscribed to service X, what is the likelihood that he would also subscribe to service Y?
Subscriber analytics is a vital solution for the modern communication service provider (CSP) to understand service behaviors and quality. As CSP’s continue their evolution towards becoming service providers and delivering on the promises of next-generation service and products. The CSPs are constantly faced challenge on the best course of action. These includes:
•  How to increase the average revenue per subscriber? 
• Who are our most valuable customers? 
• Whom and How should we target for the next promotion? 
• How do we find the ideal bundle of products? 
• How do we enhance customer loyalty?
It naturally follows that they must have intelligent insights into their subscriber’s quality of experience (QoE), behavior and usage
